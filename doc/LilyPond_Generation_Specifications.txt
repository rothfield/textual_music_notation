LilyPond Generation Specifications
----------------------------------

1️⃣  Mapping of Sargam Pitches to Western pitches
-------------------------------------------
The notation SrRgGmMPdDnN maps to the following western notation pitches:
- S → c
  S# -> C#
- r → db
- R → d
  R#   D#
- g → eb
- G → e
- m → f
- M → f#
  Pb  Gb
- P → g
  P#  G#
- d → ab
- D → a
  D#  A#
- n → bb
- N → b


We will use the english.ly lilypond directive, which lets us use fs and bb for example, for F# and Bb

North Indian solfege doesn't use S# R# Pb P# or D# but they are included
for completeness.

2️⃣  Beat and Duration Calculation
----------------------------------
- One Beat is always cosidered a 1/4 note
- There is the concept of beat divisions. 

S---   one beat, beat divisions=4
S--r--  one beat, beat divisions = 6

beat divisions are calculated by the number of units in the beat. A pitch or a dash counts one unit.
pitch has a subdivision attribute, which is 1 + the number of consecutive dashes following.
Dashes may sometimes become rests. if a  dash becomes a rest, then the subdivisions = 1 + number of consecute following dashes.

- Durations are determined by:
  - The number of dashes (-) extending the note within the beat.
  - Example:
    - S--r:
      -    S--     → 3/4 of a 1/4 note → 3/16 of a whole note.

      -    r      → 1/4 of a 1/4 note → 1/16 of a whole note.


3️⃣  Fraction Reduction and Tuplets
------------------------------------
- Durations must be represented in powers of 2.
- If the duration does not fit a power of 2, it should be wrapped in a tuplet.
- Use /tuplet instead of \times.
- Example:
    - If a note is 3/16, it should be represented as:
      \tuplet 3/2 { c8 }

4️⃣  Dotted and Double-Dotted Notes
------------------------------------
- If a note starts at the beginning of a beat and its duration matches:
  - Dotted (e.g., 3/8, 3/4) → Use a dotted note.
  - Double-dotted (e.g., 7/8) → Use a double-dotted note.

5️⃣  Annotation Mapping
------------------------
- Octaves
  - . (upper Octave) → lilypond c', d', etc.
  - : (Highest Octave) → lilypond c'', d'', etc.
  Lower octave -> lilypond c, d, etc
  - Lowest octave  → Lilypond c,, d,, etc.

- Mordent
  - If a note has a mordent, wrap it in:
    \mordent { c }

- Tala
  - If a Tala is applied, it should be rendered as a textual marker:
    \markup { "Tala 3" }

- Lyrics
  - Lyrics align with notes:
    \lyricmode {
      sa re ga ma
    }

6️⃣  Folding Phase Completeness
-------------------------------
- All annotations are attached during the Folding Phase.
- When generating LilyPond, the parse tree will already have:
  - Octave 
  - Mordents
  - Talas 
  - Lyrics attached to LetterLineElement.

7️⃣  Generation Strategy
-------------------------
1. Traverse the LetterLine in the parse tree.
2. Generate the appropriate LilyPond code:
   - Pitches → Translated to LilyPond names.
   - Durations → Calculated based on dashes.
   - Octaves → Translated to ', , as needed.
   - Annotations → Rendered inline.
